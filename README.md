> This pipeline ingests donations and displays potentially fraudulent transactions in real time on a dashboard.

## Why?

I strongly believe in the power of generosity and the importance of enabling people to give back. That’s why it's equally critical to protect against misuse—such as the example below. This project aims to detect and prevent misuse in quickly, preserving trust in donation programs.

## How?

**Technologies used:**

- **Frontend:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit (Python)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Analytics:** Pandas / Matplotlib

Incoming donation data is captured in real-time using a **FastAPI webhook**. When a transaction is made, the webhook receives the payload and stores it in a **Supabase database**, enabling low-latency ingestion.

This system enables near real-time fraud detection and donation analysis with minimal latency between ingestion and visualization.
